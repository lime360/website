    <p>Q: Do you have Twitter/Facebook/Instagram?
    <br>
    A: I had multiple Twitter acoounts but they all gone.

    I also had a Facebook account back in 2019, but then i deleted it because i don't want Mark Zukerberg to spy on me.

    I also have an Instagram account which i don't use it, and later i deleted it too.
    <br>
    I prefer contacting by using e-mail or other types of online communication. I also have five Fediverse accounts as an alternative to mentioned above platforms, but i'm mostly active on Youtube, Neocities and Discord.
